			<h1>FAQ - Vidiation</h1>
			<p><b>Q:</b> What is this site?<br><b>A:</b> We are a public video sharing community, this site was created to give content creators from vast backgrounds and trades a platform to showcase their work, join a passonate community and create media that they and others with similar interests enjoy.</p>
			<p><b>Q:</b> What are the rules?<br><b>A:</b> You can read all about that <a href="../help">here</a></p>
			<p><b>Q:</b> Can I earn money through making videos<br><b>A:</b> Yes! But what’s the catch? Well, on Vidiation when you upload a video, the page will hold enough advertisements to cover the costs of playing the video; (more info link here). Meaning there must always have some form of advertisement on the page. This however can be as small as a banner ad or sometimes may be a video advertisement. For your first 1000 views of your first videos, Vidiation will earn money generated from your video, this is not just to cover costs but also allows us to view your video and inspect feedback that may have been given in that time. If your video checks out and hasn’t broken any of our rules, then congrats!
			<br><br>Two thinga to note, if we check your video in that time and we conclude it checks out… we may just allow you to receive money from it anyway. Also, if your video becomes a hit and you have a sudden spike in views before you have filed the paperwork, that’s okay. We will hold the earnings and then forward them to you!</p>
			<p><b>Q:</b> I made a viewing account, how can I make a creator account?<br><b>A:</b></p>
			<p><b>Q:</b> I want to seperate my content from my current account, what can I do?<br><b>A:</b> We thought of that and understand the convenience of this approach. To make this easier on our end, in terms of billing and matinence; you can create a primary station, and upon that create multiple channels. For example, you may do frequent game playthoughs and then animation on the side, creating primary profile and username, you can then create brances in your profile to seperate content so your viewers can better follow their interests. e.g "Bradginar": "Bradginar" Animation - "Bradginar" Games - "Bradginar" Music </p> <!-- YO! if not the primary, then sub channels option, go with the option to let creators make many channels but then ease the process by asking if they already have an account, allowing them to use billing addresses and whatsoever from there -->
			<p><b>Q:</b> Someone has taken my username and I already have a well established brand/fanbase<br><b>A:</b> We are well aware of cybersquatting and understand the importance in securing your username. If you have experienced this we have various ways of verifing your identiy and retreaving said username for you, this may be through social media verificaion, video call/interview ect. more on that <a href="#">here</a></p>
			<p><b>Q:</b> Is this site monitored by the creators?<br><b>A:</b> Yep! While the use of site wide AI could be quick and easy, it can also be finiky. That is why we have decided to streamline our guidelines and checkups using real people, so you can be rest assured we will be on the lookout for *pointing to screen emoji*</p>
			<p><b>Q:</b> What does this site look for / want from uploaders<br><b>A:</b> Not much really, as long as you follow the rules and keep the guidelines in mind you should be fine. We love seeing what fun, new, captivating and perculiar ideas can bring to the table </p>
			<p><b>Q:</b> Got any quirky nicknames for creators on your site?<br><b>A:</b> Vidiators?</p>
			<p><b>Q:</b><br><b>A:</b></p>
